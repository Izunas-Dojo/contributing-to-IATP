### THIS IS A HEAVY WIP

> By NinjaRaven

All text relevant to the project is in .txt files. Every game's site has its own repo, every piece of media has its own folder. For the sake of convenience, inside each folder will be both the original Japanese text, as well as the English translation (as it gets added).

While not absolutely required, it's a good idea to update the roadmap yourself when committing a significant edit to the repo.

When making a change to a text file, please DO NOT play around with the line breaks. Spacing things properly is my responsibility alone. This is to prevent issues when re-inserting translated text into the raw files.

If you're not sure about an edit you want to make, please submit an issue, and I will respond ASAP. Thanks in advance!
