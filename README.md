Documentation and guides for contributing to the Izuna Archival/Translation Project.

### THIS IS A HEAVY WIP

All text relevant to the project is in .txt files. Every game's site has its own repo, every piece of media has its own folder. For the sake of convenience, inside each folder will be both the original Japanese text, as well as the English translation (as it gets added).

While not absolutely required, it's good etiquette to update the roadmap yourself when committing a significant edit to the repo.
