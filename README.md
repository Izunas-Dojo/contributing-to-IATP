### THIS IS A HEAVY WIP

> By NinjaRaven

All text relevant to the project is in .txt files. Every game's site has its own repo, every section of the site has its own folder. For the sake of convenience, inside each folder will be both the original Japanese text files, as well as the English translation (as it gets added).

Keep in mind that when you submit a translation for an image, you should edit the .txt file for it instead, and I will add the text to the image myself, for the sake of consistency.

While not absolutely required, it's good etiquette to update the roadmap yourself when committing a significant edit to a repo.

If you're not sure about an edit you want to make, please submit an issue, and I will respond ASAP. Thanks in advance!
